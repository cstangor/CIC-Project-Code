This is an R project that was used to analyze a large database of student data from the University of Maryland. The project creates a plot showing the expected scores of students in comparison to their actual scores across hundreds of classes.

There was substantial data manipulation involved as the data came from 10 different .csv files, many from different administrative areas on campus.
